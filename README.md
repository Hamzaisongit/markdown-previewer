# Goal
- complete the certification projects

# What i came across
- did'nt know u could import library directly as urls too
- learned how to parse a markdown text to html from marked library documentation
- used react router for the first time

## User flow
1. open the site
2. enter markdown text
3. click the preview button
4. get directed to preview page

## Data flow
1. context global object standard practice used for storing parsed html 
2. usere enters markdown text on editor nd clicks on preview
3. input is taken and passed to parsing function which will change data state in context globalObj
4. preview page reflects this change on page

## Logic and algo
- nothing such..
